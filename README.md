omniauth-gplus
=========

`omniauth-gplus` is a Google+ strategy for OmniAuth.
It allows you to easily interact with the Google+ OAuth2 endpoint.


Installing
----------

**Requirements**:
  A GPlus API key/secret

You can either install manually:

``` bash
$ gem install omniauth-gplus
```

Or put it in your `Gemfile`:

``` ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'omniauth-gplus', '~> 2.0'
```


Examples
--------

To use `omniauth-gplus` in Rails you only need to put this in a initializer:

``` ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :gplus, ENV['GPLUS_KEY'], ENV['GPLUS_SECRET']
end
```

By default the gem uses the `userinfo.email` scope, but you can get more information by using this interface:

``` ruby
provider :gplus, ENV['GPLUS_KEY'], ENV['GPLUS_SECRET'], scope: 'userinfo.email, userinfo.profile'
```

Here are the different scopes:

  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile

To identify the user as "me" in all requests use this scope:

  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.me

To get all of these AND log the user in:

  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login

If you use the `plus.login` scope you can request `visibleactions` in order to allow your app to post App Activities on behalf of your users.  To request `visibleactions`, use the following interface:

```ruby
provider :gplus, ENV['GPLUS_KEY'], ENV['GPLUS_SECRET'], scope: 'plus.login', request_visible_actions: 'AddActivity,BuyActivity'
```

To see and learn about all of the available App Activity types, visit: https://developers.google.com/+/api/moment-types/

To get a refresh token please pass the following:

```ruby
provider :gplus, ENV['GPLUS_KEY'], ENV['GPLUS_SECRET'], scope: 'plus.login', request_visible_actions: 'AddActivity,BuyActivity', access_type: 'offline'
```

The information schema looks like this:

``` ruby
info do
  {
    'email' => 'sam@sam-dunne.com',
    'name' => 'Sam Dunne',
    'first_name' => 'Sam',
    'last_name' => 'Dunne',
    'image' => 'http://somelongurl.png',
    'urls' => {
      "Google+" => 'http://urltouserprofile.com'
    }
  }
end

extra do
  {
    'locale' => 'en',
    'gender' => 'male',
    'birthday' => '2013-12-24',
    'raw_info' => # huge hash
  }
end
```
